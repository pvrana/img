An imaging report is an important source of information for healthcare professionals across all types of healthcare providers regarding the patient's health status and any medical complications. The REPORT is considered crucial because the attending physician determines the further course of action based on the medical findings contained in the report. REPORTS from previous examinations, even those conducted for other healthcare providers, are important for assessing the development of the patient's health status or complications. The availability of these REPORTS among healthcare providers is a significant need in modern medicine.

Imaging methods are complementary health services that are performed exclusively upon request (a service request) by the attending physician who ordered the examination. The attending physician may not be from the same healthcare facility. The primary recipient of the IMAGING REPORT is the attending physician who ordered the examination. However, the REPORTS can also serve as a source of information for various other recipients, including the patient, and can be a source of information useful for other purposes.

The exchange or sharing of REPORTS among different entities is mostly non-standardized and does not allow the nature of the data contained in this medical documentation to be determined without actually opening and reading the document.

The aim of this document is to define a standardized informational content and structure of the data set for imaging reports, including metadata that will meet the needs for use cases described later and (considering the possibility of cross-border exchange) but also useful in the local environment of individual providers.

The list of use cases arising from "business" requirements is summarized below in Table 2. The subject of this functional specification is only use case UC5.2.1, which specifies the creation of an electronic health record with structured exchange content. Use cases UC5.2.2-3 are addressed within WP5.5 - Exchange of Medical Documentation. Use cases UC5.2.4-5 are not included in the scope of the functional specification.

### Use Case Overview Table
| UC Number | UC Name | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| *.1 | Creation of Report | The report can be delivered to:
- the entity that requested the medical procedure
- another entity (for example, when the patient is referred to another facility)
- the patient
The report should contain both machine-readable and human-readable content! |
